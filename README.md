This is a repo where I store most of my random electronics projects that i dont think it needs its own repo (mostly because they are purely analog and dont require any code or related) and i want too keep schematics for repairs and beign able to reproduce it later and share with the world.

Each project has its own folder containing a schematic and a brief descriptio on a README file, any complimentary file will be there as well.
