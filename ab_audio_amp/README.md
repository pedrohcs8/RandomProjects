This is a simple design on an AB Amplifier, it can be used with the output of a smartphone and has decent volume with small 4/8 ohm speakers from radios or TV's. Quality is not awesome, but is definelty bareble and its pretty simple for what it is, for better gain (and probably quality) use a negative supply instead of the voltage divider trick and there are several other improvements, like a pop prevention circuit and etc.
