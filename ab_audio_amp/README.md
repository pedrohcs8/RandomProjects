This is a simple design for a class AB Amplifier, it can be used with the output of a smartphone and has decent volume with small 4/8 ohm speakers from radios or TV's (Use bigger BJT's, output resistors and heatsinks for higher power applications and higher volume/gain). Quality is quite OK (use proper original op amps for best quality) and the circuit has no pop when powered on.
